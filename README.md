A small guide to understanding the basics of dart

## Aim

To enhance the learning path and explain the fundamentals of Dart from a learner's point of view.

## Dart

> Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.

As the above quote suggests, dart is a language primarily for *development*.

It is a purely *object oriented language* in that every instance of code within dart is an equivalent object that represents that code.

It is stylistically similar to C and uses the familiar *block style* syntax.

The guide is stripped down into chapters with each chapter, focusing on specific parts of the language or a more general approach to that topic.

## The Chapters

- Chapter One - The Basics
- Chapter Two - Functions & their Nature
- Chapter Three - Classes
- Chapter Four - Advanced Concepts
