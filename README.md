# The Dart Programming Language

## dart (repository)

A small yet comprehensive guide to the core concepts of Dart.

## Aim

To enhance the learning path and explain the fundamentals of Dart from a learner's point of view.

## Dart

> Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.

As the above quote suggests, dart is a language primarily for *development*.

It is built with the idea of facilitating the *design* and *performance* of user applications.

## Nature of Dart

It is a purely *object oriented language* in that, every instance of code within dart is an equivalent object that represents that code. It is syntatically similar to the *C language* and uses the familiar *block style* syntax.  

```dart
//This is a block, enclosed by curly brackets
{
  //statement1
  //statement2
  //  .
  //  .
}
```

It is also a compiled language, and has its own virtual machine to run Dart, called the Dart VM which has extensive features like *hot reload* and *AOT compilation* to enhance productivity of *development*.

>Note: The functionality of Dart VM is not discussed here, this guide is to introduce the Dart language and it's core concepts.

The guide is stripped down into chapters, with each chapter containing sections, focusing on specific parts of the language or a more general approach to that topic.

## The Chapters

- Chapter One - The Basics
- Chapter Two - Functions & their Nature
- Chapter Three - Classes
- Chapter Four - Advanced Concepts

## Where to practice

One can run Dart code right within the browser, to get a feel for the language or to execute certain code snippets from the guide, follow the below link,

- [Go To Dartpad][dartpad]

If one intends to use Dart for various development purposes, you can download the Dart SDK,

- [Download Dart SDK][dartsdk]

If you are intending to use Dart for Flutter, then you do not require the dart SDK as flutter already provides Dart with the Flutter SDK, to download flutter, go to the given link and follow the steps listed there.

- [Download Flutter SDK][fluttersdk]
